    <h1 class="title">WHAT IS EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE?</h1>
    <p>
      Emotional intelligence is about being in tune with your own emotions and
      having the skills to understand and handle them in a positive way. It also
      means being able to empathize with others, recognizing their emotions, and
      responding to them appropriately.

    <h1 class="title">HOW IS EQ DIFFERENT TO IQ?</h1>

    <p>
      IQ is primarily concerned with cognitive abilities and intellectual
      capacity, while EQ focuses on emotional awareness and interpersonal
      skills. IQ measures how smart someone is in traditional academic terms,
      while EQ measures how well someone understands and manages emotions, both
      within themselves and in their interactions with others.
    </p>

    <h1 class="title">WHY IS EQ IMPORTANT?</h1>

    <p>
      EQ is important because it enhances our relationships, decision-making,
      communication skills, emotional resilience, and leadership abilities. It
      enables us to understand ourselves and others better, leading to personal
      growth and success in various aspects of life.
