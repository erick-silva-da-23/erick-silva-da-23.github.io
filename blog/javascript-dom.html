    <h1 class="title">JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h1>
    <p>
      JavaScript is like the conductor of an orchestra, while HTML is the sheet
      music, and CSS is the stage setup. The conductor (JavaScript) guides and
      coordinates the performance, bringing life and interactivity to the
      musical piece (web page). HTML provides the structure and content, like
      the notes on the sheet music, while CSS sets the stage with visual design
      and presentation. Together, they work harmoniously to create a captivating
      and dynamic web experience, just as an orchestra combines the conductor,
      sheet music, and stage to deliver a captivating performance.

    <h1 class="title">Control Flow and Loops</h1>
    <img src="../styles/control-flow-in-java2.png" />
    <p>
      It's like making a sandwich! Control flow ensures you follow a specific
      order in making a sandwich, like a recipe, while loops come into play when
      repeating certain actions, like adding toppings, until you achieve the
      desired outcome.
    </p>
    <h1 class="title">DOM</h1>
    <p>
      The DOM (Document Object Model) represents the structure and content of an
      HTML or XML document, allowing programmers to interact with and manipulate
      the elements of a web page dynamically. By using the DOM, we can access,
      modify, add, or remove elements and their properties on a web page.
    </p>

    <h1 class="title">Arrays vs Objects</h1>

    <p>
      Arrays use numerical indices to access data based on the element's
      position, while objects use keys to access data based on the associated
      value's identifier.
    </p>

    <h1 class="title">FUNCTIONS</h1>

    <p>
      Functions are like reusable sets of instructions that perform specific
      tasks. They promote code reusability, help break down complex problems,
      and improve code readability, making them a powerful and helpful tool.
