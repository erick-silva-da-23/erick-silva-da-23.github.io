    <p>
      Throughout my time in the Foundations course, I've learned some important things about myself and how I learn. I found out that sometimes, my ego can get in the way of learning because I might feel discouraged when I make mistakes. It surprised me that the course focused so much on personal development alongside programming skills. The hardest part for me was dealing with my own doubts and limitations.
    </p>
    <p>Values, empathy, and knowing myself better turned out to be really important in learning and programming. Understanding what's important to me helps me stay focused, while empathy helps me work better with others. Knowing my strengths and weaknesses helps me choose the best way to learn and ask for help when I need it.</p>
    <p>Even though I might have thought at first that all my time should be spent practicing programming, I don't think studying core learning was a waste of time. It helped me become a better learner and team member, which will be important for my career in web development.</p>
