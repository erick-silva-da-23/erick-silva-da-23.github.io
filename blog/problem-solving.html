    <h1 class="title">Problem Solving</h1>
    
   <h1> Story 1: Blocked on a Simple Problem</h1> 
    <p> Problem: I was doing these little coding challenges online, and one of them was to reverse a word. Seemed easy, right?</p>
    <p>Solution Attempts: I tried different ways to flip the word around. I looped through the letters, tried using special functions, but nothing worked.</p>
    <p>Feelings: At first, I was confident. But as I struggled, I got frustrated. I kept thinking, "Why can't I get this right?"</p>
    <p>Lesson: Even easy problems can trip you up in coding. It's okay to ask for help or look up solutions. And sometimes, trying a different approach can help crack the problem.</p>

    <h1>Story 2: Elegantly Solved a Problem</h1>
  <p>Problem: A typo was crashing my code.</p>
  <p>Solution: Checked my code carefully, talked through it with a rubber duck, and found a small typo.</p>
  <p>Feelings: Started frustrated, but felt confident and satisfied when I found the mistake.</p>
  <p>Lesson: Rubber ducky method works well. Patience and calmness are key.</p>
  
  <h1>Reflection on Problem-Solving Techniques</h1>
 <p>Pseudocode: Helps plan before coding, very useful.</p>
 <p>Trying something: Good for experimenting but needs to be combined with other techniques.</p>
 <p>Rubber ducky method: Surprisingly effective, helps find mistakes.</p>
 <p>Reading error messages: Essential, they guide where to focus.</p>
 <p>Console.logging: Handy for debugging JavaScript.</p>
 <p>Googling: Great for learning and solving problems.</p>
 <p>Asking peers: Comfortable with this, gets fresh perspectives.</p>
 <p>Asking coaches: Sometimes hesitant, but recognize their expertise.</p>
 <p>Improving process: Reflecting helps me get better.</p>
 
 <h1>Reluctance to Ask for Help</h1>
<p>I've been scared to ask for help at times, worrying about looking bad or bothering others. But I've learned it's normal and necessary for learning. Next time, I'll remind myself it's okay and most people are happy to help.</p>
