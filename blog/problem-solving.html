    <h1 class="title">Problem Solving</h1>
    <p>
      Once, I struggled with a puzzle but learned to break it down and seek help, ultimately solving it. Another time, I fixed a toy car through patience and trying different methods. I feel confident using pseudocode, trying various approaches, discussing problems, reading error messages, console.logging, Googling, asking peers and coaches for help, and improving through reflection. I've been reluctant to ask for help due to fear of bothering others, but I'm learning it's okay and beneficial for growth.
