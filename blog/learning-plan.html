    <h1 class="title">LEARNING PLAN</h1>
    <h1 class="title">Mastering Web Development</h1>

    <p>
      My learning plan focuses on gaining comprehensive skills in both front-end
      and back-end development. Starting with the fundamentals, I will learn
      HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create well-structured and visually appealing
      web pages. Building upon that, I will explore popular front-end frameworks
      like React or Vue.js to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
      Simultaneously, I will delve into server-side programming using Node.js
      with Express or Django with Python to handle data, create APIs, and
      implement authentication. I will also acquire knowledge of databases,
      including SQL and both relational and NoSQL databases. Additionally, I
      will familiarize myself with deployment techniques, version control
      systems like Git, and testing methodologies. Through continuous learning,
      personal projects, and collaboration, I aim to enhance my skills, stay
      up-to-date with industry trends, and ultimately become a proficient web
      developer.
