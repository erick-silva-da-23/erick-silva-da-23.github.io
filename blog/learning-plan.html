    <h1 class="title">LEARNING PLAN</h1>
    <h1 class="title">1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h1>

    <p>
      My goal is to have stability and peace in life and I would like to achieve it by doing something I enjoy like coding.
    </p>

    <h1 class="title">2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.
    </h1>
    <p>Taking the first step for anything in my life has been my biggest struggle, but once I pop that confort bubble I become hyperfocused. Breaking that uncertainty barrier is what I need to work on.
    </p>

    <h1 class="title">3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? 
    </h1>
    <p>Camaraderie skills. Like getting better at knowing what your workmates need from you for the team to be succesful.
    </p>

    <h1 class="title">4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h1>
      <h1 class="title">• An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
    </h1>
<p>Being ready and willing to study/work. Having good time management (like sleep, eat and leisure.). Following a routine. Having a quiet place to work on.</p>
<h1 class="title">• What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h1>

<p>Comunicate. If it is something that will impact your team the most unresponsible thing to do would be to stay quiet.</p>

<h1 class="title">5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h1>
<p>I would seek help by first using Ctrl + F on discord. If there is nothing there about my situation I would seek help from a facilitator or classmate. If no one is available then it will be google :P
</p>

<h1 class="title">6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
</h1>

<p>Having a facilitator is one of the biggest benefits and one of the main reasons to why I chose to study at Dev Academy. The way I see them is like a bigger brother that show us the way of the dev world. I really don't know what to expect from them other than being there to help us and point out our errors. I often read from self-learners that they wish they could have a professional by their side.</p>

<h1 class="title">7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
</h1>

<p>No plans. Only gym maybe but that would be outside bootcamp time anyway.</p>
