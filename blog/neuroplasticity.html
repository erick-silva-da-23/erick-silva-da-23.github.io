    <h1 class="title">Neuroplasticity</h1>
    <p>
      Neuroplasticity is like the brain being a flexible friend, always changing
      and adapting. It means I can learn new things and get smarter, even if it
      takes me a bit longer. Growth mindset is like having a positive attitude,
      thinking that I can get better at stuff if I keep trying. It helps me not
      feel bad about making mistakes and encourages me to keep learning, even
      when it's tough. So, neuroplasticity and growth mindset make me feel like
      I can learn and grow, even if it's a bit harder for me.
